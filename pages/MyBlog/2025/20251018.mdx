## Â Next.js learning

### Removed unused projects

I went through my list of Next.js projects and removed those that I no longer find useful or relevant. This helps me keep my learning resources organized and focused on the most important topics.

The projects I moved to the git-delete folder are:

- /Users/bulent/git-delete/nextjs-f-v0
- /Users/bulent/git-delete/nextjs-f-v1

### Project Notes

#### Project: nextra-docs (/Users/bulent/git-msp/nextra-docs)

- This project is a documentation site built with Nextra, a Next.js-based static site generator.
- My alternative to mkdocs for generating documentation sites.
- Blog continues from there in /MyBlog
