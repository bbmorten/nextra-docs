## Â Next.js learning

### Removed unused projects

I went through my list of Next.js and react projects and removed those that I no longer find useful or relevant. This helps me keep my learning resources organized and focused on the most important topics.

The projects I moved to the git-delete folder are:

/Users/bulent/git-delete/nextjs-f-v0

/Users/bulent/git-delete/nextjs-f-v1

/Users/bulent/git-msp/react/react-basics

<br />
<div style={{ marginLeft: '2rem' }}>
  <img src="/assets/images/screenshot_1.png" alt="Project Screenshot" width={400} height={240} />
</div>

Deleted projects are:

/Users/bulent/git-msp/react/learn-react
