#  Passwordless Sudo

Kubernetes cluster installation ansible script has worked with the alternative solution

To stop Ubuntu from asking for a sudo password, you need to configure passwordless sudo. This is done by modifying the sudoers file. Here’s how:

1. **Open the sudoers File Safely**  
   Always use the `visudo` command to edit the sudoers file to avoid syntax errors. Run:

   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

2. **Add a Passwordless Sudo Entry**  
   Locate the section where user privileges are defined, and add a line for your user. For example, if your username is `your_username`, add:

   ```plaintext
   your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

   This line allows `your_username` to run all commands as any user without being prompted for a password.

3. **Save and Exit**  
   If you're using nano as the editor (the default on many systems), press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and hit `Enter` to save your changes.

4. **Alternative: Use the /etc/sudoers.d/ Directory**  
   Instead of modifying the main sudoers file, you can create a dedicated file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/your_username
   ```

   Add the same line:

   ```plaintext
   your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

   Save and exit. This method helps keep your customizations organized and avoids potential issues when updating the main sudoers file.
