# Â To split a pcap file into four parts

To split a pcap file into four parts, you can use various tools like `editcap` from the Wireshark suite or Python libraries such as `scapy` or `pyshark`. Here, I'll show you how to do it using `editcap`, which is straightforward and efficient.

## Using `editcap` from Wireshark

1. **Install Wireshark** (if you haven't already):
   - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install wireshark`
   - On macOS: `brew install wireshark`
   - On Windows: Download and install from the [Wireshark website](https://www.wireshark.org/).

2. **Split the pcap file** using `editcap`:
   - First, determine the total number of packets in the pcap file using `capinfos`:

     ```sh
     capinfos -c yourfile.pcap
     ```

   - Suppose the output indicates there are `4000` packets, you can split the file into four parts with `1000` packets each using `editcap`:

     ```sh
     editcap -c 1000 yourfile.pcap part
     ```

     This will create files named `part_00000_20230609120000.pcap`, `part_00001_20230609120000.pcap`, `part_00002_20230609120000.pcap`, and `part_00003_20230609120000.pcap`.

## Using Python with `pyshark`

If you prefer a Python solution, you can use the `pyshark` library:

1. **Install Pyshark**:

   ```sh
   pip install pyshark
   ```

2. **Script to split the pcap file**:

   ```python
   import pyshark

   def split_pcap(file_path, num_parts):
       cap = pyshark.FileCapture(file_path)
       total_packets = len(cap)
       packets_per_part = total_packets // num_parts

       for i in range(num_parts):
           start = i * packets_per_part
           end = (i + 1) * packets_per_part if i != num_parts - 1 else total_packets
           part_filename = f"{file_path}_part_{i+1}.pcap"

           with pyshark.FileCapture(file_path, only_summaries=True) as pcap_reader:
               with open(part_filename, 'wb') as pcap_writer:
                   for j, packet in enumerate(pcap_reader):
                       if start <= j < end:
                           pcap_writer.write(packet.packet)

   split_pcap('yourfile.pcap', 4)
   ```

Replace `'yourfile.pcap'` with the path to your pcap file. This script reads the pcap file, splits it into four parts, and writes each part to a new pcap file.

Choose the method that best fits your needs and environment. The `editcap` method is faster and more efficient for large files, while the Python script offers more flexibility if you need to process the packets in Python.
