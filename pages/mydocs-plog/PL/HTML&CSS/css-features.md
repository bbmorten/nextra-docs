## Anchor Positioning API

The [CSS Anchor Positioning](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchor-positioning-api) API is a game-changer in web development because it lets you natively position elements relative to other elements, known as anchors. This API simplifies complex layout requirements for many interface features like menus and submenus, tooltips, selects, labels, cards, settings dialogs, and many more. With anchor positioning built into the browser, you'll be able to build layered user interfaces without relying on third-party libraries, opening a world of creative possibilities.

Anchor positioning is available from Chrome 125.
