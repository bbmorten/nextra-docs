##  Implementing tagging with django-taggit

A very common functionality in blogs is categorizing posts using tags. Tags allow you to categorize content in a non-hierarchical manner, using simple keywords. A tag is simply a label or keyword that can be assigned to posts. We will create a tagging system by integrating a third-party Django tagging application into the project.

django-taggit is a reusable application that primarily offers you a Tag model and a manager to easily add tags to any model. You can take a look at its source code at <https://github.com/jazzband/django-taggit>.
