## Â Dispatch

In programming, **dispatch** refers to the process of selecting which function or method to execute when a program runs. The term is commonly associated with object-oriented programming but is also applicable in other paradigms. There are several types of dispatch, each serving different purposes:

### Types of Dispatch

1. **Static Dispatch** (also known as **Compile-Time Dispatch**):
   - The method or function to be executed is determined at compile time.
   - This type is commonly seen with function overloading in languages like C++ and Java. The compiler decides which function to call based on the type and number of arguments.
   - Example: Method overloading in Java.

2. **Dynamic Dispatch** (also known as **Run-Time Dispatch**):
   - The method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.
   - It is typically used in object-oriented languages that support inheritance and polymorphism.
   - Example: Method overriding in Java, where the overridden method in the derived class is called based on the runtime type of the object.

3. **Single Dispatch**:
   - A function or method is chosen based on the type of a single object.
   - Most object-oriented programming languages use single dispatch by default.

4. **Multiple Dispatch**:
   - A function or method is chosen based on the runtime types of more than one of its arguments.
   - Some languages, like Common Lisp and Julia, support multiple dispatch, allowing a more flexible and powerful form of polymorphism.

5. **Message Dispatch**:
   - In some languages, like Smalltalk, sending a message to an object is a form of dispatch. The object determines which method to call in response to the message.

6. **Dynamic Method Dispatch**:
   - A core concept in languages like Java and Python where methods that are overridden by subclasses are invoked by the object instance, allowing for polymorphism.

### Real-World Example

In JavaScript, dispatch is often seen in event handling:

```javascript
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});
```

When a user clicks the button, the event handler is dispatched, and the corresponding function is executed.

### In Summary

Dispatch is a core concept in programming, allowing flexibility and reusability of code by dynamically determining which function or method should execute based on different criteria such as type, context, or event.
