## Mkdocs-material math rendering

To show the inner product of vectors in documentation created with MkDocs, you would typically use Markdown syntax, possibly combined with a mathematical typesetting tool like MathJax or KaTeX if you need to display mathematical symbols or equations. MkDocs itself is a static site generator that converts Markdown files into HTML, but it doesn't directly support complex mathematical notation. However, plugins like `mkdocs-material` can integrate with MathJax or KaTeX to render mathematics.

Here's a step-by-step guide to showing the inner product of vectors in MkDocs:

1. **Ensure Math Rendering is Enabled**:
   - If you are using the `mkdocs-material` extension, it supports MathJax and KaTeX. You need to enable one of these in your `mkdocs.yml` configuration file.
   - For MathJax, add the following to `mkdocs.yml`:

     ```yaml
     extra_javascript:
       - https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6
       - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js
     ```

   - For KaTeX, you can include the KaTeX CSS and JS files in your `mkdocs.yml`.

2. **Write the Markdown for the Inner Product**:
   - In your Markdown file, you can write the inner product using LaTeX syntax inside MathJax or KaTeX delimiters.
   - For example, the inner product of vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) can be written as:

     The inner product of vectors **a** and **b** is given by:

     $$
     \langle \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \rangle = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \ldots + a_nb_n
     $$

3. **Build Your MkDocs Site**:
   - After adding your content, build your site using `docker build ./mkdocs.Dockerfile` and `docker compose up -d` to see the changes live.

4. **Check the Rendered Output**:
   - Open your MkDocs site in a browser. The inner product expression should be rendered as a mathematical equation.

This approach assumes that your MkDocs setup is already configured to handle mathematical expressions via MathJax or KaTeX. If it's not, you may need to consult the documentation for `mkdocs-material` or MkDocs for more detailed setup instructions.

###  Orthogonal vectors

Orthogonal vectors are vectors that are at right angles (90 degrees) to each other. In a two-dimensional space (like on a flat plane), it's easy to visualize orthogonal vectors.

Two vectors are called orthogonal if their inner product is zero.

```python
np.sum(x * y)          # Inner product of x and y
```

###  Norm of a vector a.k.a its length

```python
np.sqrt(np.sum(x**2))  # Norm of x, take one
```

The inner product of vectors **a** and **b** is given by:

$$
\langle \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \rangle = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \ldots + a_nb_n
$$

$$
x' y := \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i
$$
