##  Mapstruct

MapStruct is a code generator that simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types based on a convention-over-configuration approach. It is an annotation processor which is plugged into the Java compiler and can be used in both Maven and Gradle projects. MapStruct uses annotations to define mappings, thereby reducing the boilerplate code developers need to write when mapping fields from one object to another.

### Key Features of MapStruct

- **Type-Safe Mappings**: MapStruct generates compile-time type-safe mappings, which reduces runtime errors and the need for manual casting.
- **Performance**: Since it generates code at compile-time, the mapping code runs very fast, similar to hand-written mappings.
- **Readable Code**: The generated mapping code is straightforward, readable, and uses plain method invocations, making it easy to debug and understand.
- **Customizable Mappings**: While it relies on convention for simple mappings, MapStruct allows for extensive customization through annotations. Developers can specify custom methods for complex mappings, apply default values, and more.
- **Deep Mapping**: MapStruct supports nested properties and collections out of the box, allowing for complex data structures to be mapped with minimal configuration.
- **Integration**: It works well with popular frameworks and libraries such as Spring, CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection), and can be used in any Java-based project.

### How MapStruct Works

MapStruct scans for interfaces or abstract classes annotated with `@Mapper`. For each mapping method defined in these interfaces, MapStruct generates an implementation class at compile time. This class includes the code necessary to perform the mapping between the source and target objects according to the specified mappings.

For example, consider two classes, `Order` and `OrderDto`, where you need to map instances of `Order` to `OrderDto`. With MapStruct, you simply define an interface annotated with `@Mapper`, and declare a method to map `Order` to `OrderDto`. MapStruct generates the implementation during the compilation process.

### Example Usage

```java
@Mapper
public interface OrderMapper {

    OrderMapper INSTANCE = Mappers.getMapper(OrderMapper.class);

    OrderDto orderToOrderDto(Order order);
}
```

In this example, MapStruct takes care of generating the code that maps `Order` to `OrderDto` based on the properties that match by name (and type, with conversions if necessary).

### Conclusion

MapStruct stands out for its simplicity, efficiency, and the reduction of boilerplate code required for object mappings in Java applications. It's particularly useful in layered architectures, such as web applications where you often need to map between entity models and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects). The use of MapStruct can significantly improve the maintainability and clarity of the codebase in such scenarios.

##  Liquibase

[Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org) works with 59 databases.

```shell
brew install liquibase

```

##  Other Tools

Can you list me alternatives for liquibase

Certainly! Liquibase is a popular open-source library for tracking, managing, and applying database schema changes. However, there are several other tools available that serve similar purposes, each with its own set of features and approaches to database version control and migration. Here are some notable alternatives to Liquibase:

1. **Flyway**:
   - **Website**: [Flyway by Redgate](https://flywaydb.org/)
   - **Description**: Flyway is an open-source database migration tool that emphasizes simplicity and convention over configuration. It supports SQL-based migrations as well as Java-based migrations for advanced data transformations. Flyway is known for its ease of use and seamless integration with build tools and frameworks.

2. **DbUp**:
   - **Website**: [DbUp](https://dbup.github.io/)
   - **Description**: DbUp is a .NET library that helps you to deploy changes to SQL Server databases. It tracks which SQL scripts have been run already, and runs the change scripts that are needed to get your database up to date.

3. **Sqitch**:
   - **Website**: [Sqitch](https://sqitch.org/)
   - **Description**: Sqitch is a database change management application that does not rely on conventions or metadata tables within the database, focusing instead on changes as first-class entities. It supports planning, scripting, and applying database changes reliably and is not tied to any framework.

4. **SchemaSpy**:
   - **Website**: [SchemaSpy](http://schemaspy.org/)
   - **Description**: While SchemaSpy is primarily a database documentation tool that analyzes the schema of a database, it can be used in conjunction with version control systems to track changes over time. It's more of an auxiliary tool for understanding and documenting database structures rather than managing migrations.

5. **Migrate**:
   - **Website**: [GitHub - golang-migrate/migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
   - **Description**: Migrate is a database migrations library written in Go. It supports a wide range of databases and can be used both as a CLI tool and as a library in Go projects. It's designed for simplicity and managing migrations programmatically.

6. **Apache Derby**:
   - **Website**: [Apache Derby](https://db.apache.org/derby/)
   - **Description**: Apache Derby is an open-source relational database implemented entirely in Java. It has features that facilitate easy database schema evolution, but it is more of a database solution that includes versioning capabilities rather than a dedicated migration tool.

7. **Rails Active Record Migrations**:
   - **Website**: Part of the Ruby on Rails framework ([Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html))
   - **Description**: For projects using Ruby on Rails, Active Record Migrations provide a Ruby DSL for managing database schema changes. It's tightly integrated with the Rails framework, offering migrations, rollbacks, and schema versioning.

8. **Doctrine Migrations**:
   - **Website**: [Doctrine Project](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/migrations.html)
   - **Description**: For PHP applications using the Doctrine ORM, Doctrine Migrations offer a way to programmatically deploy and manage database schema updates. It provides a powerful and customizable framework for database migrations within PHP projects.

These tools vary in their approach to database schema changes, language support, and complexity. The choice among them would depend on your specific project requirements, the programming languages you use, and your preference for SQL or programmatic schema definitions.
