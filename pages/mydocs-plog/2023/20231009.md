## Â history | awk | cut

If you want to see the command history without the command numbers (which are typically shown by default in many shells),
you can use awk or cut to extract just the command part of the output.

```shell
history | awk '{$1=""; print $0}'\n
#or
history | cut -d ' ' -f 4-\n
```
