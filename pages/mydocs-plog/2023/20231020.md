## Have ChatGPT Ask You Questions

You can use ChatGPT to help you work on problems, even if you don’t want to use its output as part of your project. A great way to do that is to frame the conversation around ChatGPT helping you find the important details. You might accomplish this by setting a context (perhaps by pasting a rough draft) and having ChatGPT ask you questions about it. You can feel free to answer in shorthand, or with pasted snippets of background research; ChatGPT will synthesize that information and use it to guide writing outlines or other forms of planning.

## Generating Apps with ChatGPT

!!! Prompt

    Help me write a simple React app where users can click on emoji animals to make them jump up and down while earning a random amount of points. If a user clicks on the snake emoji, their points reset to zero. Provide me with the necessary code and components for this game.

Sure, here's a simple React app for the game you described:

1. **Setup**: First, set up a new React app if you haven't yet. Using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) is an easy way to get started:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app emoji-jump-game
    cd emoji-jump-game
    ```

2. **App Implementation**:

    - `App.js`: This will be the main file for our game.
    - `Emoji.js`: This file will contain the component for each emoji.

    ```javascript title="Emoji.js"
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

    const Emoji = ({ emoji, onSnakeClick, onAnimalClick }) => {
    const [style, setStyle] = useState({});

    useEffect(() => {
        if (emoji === '🐍') {
        setStyle({});
        return;
        }

        const jump = () => {
        setStyle({ transform: 'translateY(-20px)' });
        setTimeout(() => setStyle({ transform: 'translateY(0px)' }), 300);
        };

        jump();
    }, [emoji]);

    const handleClick = () => {
        if (emoji === '🐍') {
        onSnakeClick();
        } else {
        onAnimalClick();
        }
    };

    return (
        <span
        role="img"
        aria-label="emoji"
        style={style}
        onClick={handleClick}
        className="emoji"
        >
        {emoji}
        </span>
    );
    };

    export default Emoji;
    ```

```javascript title="App.js"
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Emoji from './Emoji';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);

  const handleAnimalClick = () => {
    const randomPoints = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; // Random points between 1 and 10.
    setScore(score + randomPoints);
  };

  const handleSnakeClick = () => {
    setScore(0); // Reset score when snake is clicked.
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Emoji Jump Game</h1>
      <p>Score: {score}</p>
      <div>
        <Emoji emoji="🐶" onSnakeClick={handleSnakeClick} onAnimalClick={handleAnimalClick} />
        <Emoji emoji="🐱" onSnakeClick={handleSnakeClick} onAnimalClick={handleAnimalClick} />
        <Emoji emoji="🦁" onSnakeClick={handleSnakeClick} onAnimalClick={handleAnimalClick} />
        <Emoji emoji="🐍" onSnakeClick={handleSnakeClick} onAnimalClick={handleAnimalClick} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```css title="App.css"
.App {
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 50px;
}

.emoji {
  font-size: 50px;
  margin: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: transform 0.3s;
}

.emoji:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

3. **Run your app**:

Once you've added the above code, you can start the app by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the game in action. You can click on the emojis, and if you click on the snake, your score will reset to zero.
