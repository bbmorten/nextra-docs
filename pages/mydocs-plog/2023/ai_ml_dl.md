##  Concepts

###  Inference Chips - Sample

> **Inference Chips** : Inference chips are specially designed accelerators for artificial neural network (ANN) based applications

> 1. They are used for the "inference" stage of AI, where artificial intelligence makes predictions based on new data
> 2. Inference chips are different from training chips, which are used to develop the tunable parameters of a neural network program. Inference chips are deployed in devices that need to perform AI tasks quickly and efficiently.
