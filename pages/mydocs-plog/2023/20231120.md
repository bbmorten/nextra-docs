##  Angular Material

As of my last update in April 2023, several prebuilt user interface (UI) component collections are popular among Angular developers. The choice of a UI component library often depends on the specific needs of the project, such as design requirements, customization flexibility, and overall functionality. Some of the most widely used UI component libraries for Angular include:

1. **Angular Material**: Developed and maintained by the Angular team, Angular Material offers a comprehensive suite of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components. Angular Material follows the Material Design guidelines, providing a consistent and visually pleasing design language.

2. **NG-ZORRO**: This is an enterprise-class UI component library based on Ant Design and Angular. It's widely used for creating rich, interactive user interfaces in Angular applications, especially in enterprise-level projects.

3. **PrimeNG**: PrimeNG is a rich set of open-source UI components for Angular. It offers a wide range of components, from basic elements like buttons and inputs to complex components like data tables and charts. PrimeNG is known for its theme support and customizability.

4. **Clarity Design System**: Developed by VMware, Clarity is both a design system and a set of UI components specifically built for Angular applications. It is focused on providing a cohesive user experience and is particularly suited for building data-intensive or enterprise applications.

5. **Kendo UI for Angular**: This is a professional-grade UI component library with a comprehensive collection of feature-rich components. Kendo UI for Angular is developed by Telerik and is often chosen for its performance and the breadth of components available, although it is a commercial product.

6. **NG Bootstrap**: This library provides Bootstrap 4 components for Angular. It's a good choice for developers looking to integrate Bootstrap's design language into their Angular applications.

7. **Nebular**: Nebular is a customizable UI kit with a focus on modularity, allowing you to pick and choose the components you need. It also integrates seamlessly with Eva Design System.

8. **Onsen UI for Angular**: Targeted at mobile app development, Onsen UI offers a wide range of components optimized for mobile devices. It is a good choice for building cross-platform mobile applications using Angular.

The popularity and suitability of these libraries can vary based on the project requirements, design preferences, and the specific version of Angular being used. It's advisable to evaluate each library based on the current needs of your project and team.
