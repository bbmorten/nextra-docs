# PostgreSQL Adapters

## Â Python adapter `psycopg`

`psycopg` and `psycopg2-binary` are both PostgreSQL adapters for Python, but they belong to different versions and have different characteristics:

### `psycopg==3.2.3`

- **Version**: 3.x
- **Description**: `psycopg` is the latest major version of the PostgreSQL adapter for Python. It is designed to be more modern and efficient than its predecessor, `psycopg2`.
- **Features**:
    - Improved performance and efficiency.
    - Better support for asynchronous programming.
    - Enhanced type system and better integration with Python's type hints.
    - More modular and extensible architecture.

### `psycopg2-binary==2.9.10`

- **Version**: 2.x
- **Description**: `psycopg2-binary` is the binary distribution of `psycopg2`, the previous major version of the PostgreSQL adapter for Python. It includes pre-compiled binaries, making it easier to install on various platforms without needing to compile from source.
- **Features**:
    - Widely used and battle-tested.
    - Compatible with a wide range of Python and PostgreSQL versions.
    - Includes pre-compiled binaries for easier installation.
    - Stable and well-documented.

### Key Differences

- **Version**: `psycopg` is the newer version (3.x), while `psycopg2-binary` is the older version (2.x).
- **Installation**: `psycopg2-binary` includes pre-compiled binaries, making it easier to install without needing to compile from source. `psycopg` may require compilation.
- **Features and Performance**: `psycopg` (3.x) offers improved performance, better support for modern Python features, and a more modular architecture compared to `psycopg2-binary` (2.x).

### Usage

- If you are starting a new project or looking for better performance and modern features, you might want to use `psycopg`.
- If you are maintaining an existing project that already uses `psycopg2-binary` or if you need the convenience of pre-compiled binaries, you might stick with `psycopg2-binary`.
