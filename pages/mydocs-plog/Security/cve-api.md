# Â CVE API (Not verifiied)

You can get the list of newly announced CVEs via several APIs that provide real-time access to CVE data. Below are some popular APIs you can use:

### 1. **MITRE CVE API**

   MITRE provides an official API that allows you to search for CVEs as they are announced:

- **Endpoint**: `https://cveawg.mitre.org/api/`
- **Example Usage**:

     ```bash
     curl https://cveawg.mitre.org/api/cve
     ```

- **Documentation**: You can view details about how to interact with the API and retrieve recent CVEs via the official documentation: [MITRE CVE API Docs](https://cveawg.mitre.org/api/)

### 2. **National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API**

   NVD, maintained by NIST, enhances CVE data and offers a well-documented API for retrieving recent CVEs.

- **Endpoint**: `https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/1.0/`
- **Example Usage**:

     ```bash
     curl "https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/1.0/?resultsPerPage=10"
     ```

- **Documentation**: [NVD API Documentation](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities)

### 3. **CIRCL CVE Search API**

   CIRCL (Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg) offers a convenient CVE Search API for fetching updated CVE entries.

- **Endpoint**: `https://cve.circl.lu/api`
- **Example Usage**:

     ```bash
     curl https://cve.circl.lu/api/last
     ```

- **Documentation**: [CIRCL API Documentation](https://cve.circl.lu/api/)

### 4. **Vulners API**

   Vulners provides a powerful vulnerability database API, including CVE feeds.

- **Endpoint**: `https://vulners.com/api/v3/search/lucene/`
- **Example Usage**:

     ```bash
     curl "https://vulners.com/api/v3/search/lucene/?query=cve"
     ```

- **Documentation**: [Vulners API Docs](https://vulners.com/docs/)

### Example for fetching CVEs

To retrieve the most recent CVEs using the NVD API, you can use the following API call:

```bash
curl "https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/1.0/?resultsPerPage=10&startIndex=0"
```

This will return the 10 most recently published CVEs in JSON format. You can parse this data in your application or script to monitor new CVEs in real-time.

Each of these APIs provides various filters and query parameters, allowing you to specify date ranges, vendors, products, and more, enabling tailored CVE tracking.
