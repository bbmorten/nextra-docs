# Â fzf

`fzf` is a command-line fuzzy finder, a general-purpose tool that can quickly filter and select items from a list based on partial input. It's incredibly useful in the Unix shell environment for tasks like locating files, browsing command history, or even as a selector for any list generated by any command. Written in Go, `fzf is fast and integrates seamlessly into the command line environment, making it a powerful tool for users who often work in the terminal.

Here are some practical examples of how `fzf` can be used:

## 1. File Search

Use `fzf` in combination with `find` to search for files in a directory:

```bash
find . -type f | fzf
```

This command finds all files (`-type f`) in the current directory and its subdirectories, and pipes the results into `fzf`. As you type, `fzf` filters the list, allowing you to select a file interactively.

## 2. Command History Search

Use `fzf` to search through your command history:

```bash
history | fzf
```

This allows you to interactively search through your shell's command history and execute commands from it.

## 3. Vim Integration

Integrate `fzf` with Vim to open files:

```vim
:Files
```

This requires the `fzf.vim` plugin. It opens a fuzzy finder session within Vim where you can search for and open files.

## 4. Git Branch Switching

Switch between Git branches using `fzf`:

```bash
git branch | fzf | xargs git checkout
```

This command lists all Git branches, lets you pick one interactively, and then checks out the selected branch.

## 5. Process Management

Kill a process interactively:

```bash
ps aux | fzf | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```

This pipeline shows a list of running processes, lets you select one, extracts the process ID, and kills the selected process.

`fzf` is highly customizable, supports color and Unicode, and can be integrated into many other tools and scripts to enhance productivity and ease of use.

Using `fzf` interactively in the shell can greatly enhance your command-line efficiency by allowing you to quickly search through large lists with minimal typing. Here are some specific examples to show how `fzf` can be used interactively in the shell:

## 1. Interactive File Search

Using `fzf` with `find` or `ls` to open files with a selected editor:

```bash
vim $(find . -type f | fzf)
```

This command finds all files under the current directory, lets you pick one interactively, and then opens it in Vim.

## 2. Improved Command History Search

An improved way to search and execute a command from history:

```bash
$(history | fzf +s +m --tac --tiebreak=index | sed 's/ *[0-9]* *//')
```

This command lets you search through your command history, select a command, and run it directly. It uses options to make the search case-insensitive (`+s`), multi-select (`+m`), list in reverse (`--tac`), and tiebreak by index (`--tiebreak=index`).

## 3. Select Multiple Files for Deletion

Select multiple files to delete:

```bash
echo "Select files to delete:" && find . -type f | fzf -m | xargs rm
```

This allows you to interactively select multiple files (using `-m` for multi-select) and delete them.

## 4. SSH into a Selected Host

Connect to a server from a list of hosts:

```bash
ssh $(cat ~/.ssh/config | grep "Host " | awk '{print $2}' | fzf)
```

This reads your SSH config file, extracts the hosts, lets you pick one, and then connects to it via SSH.

## 5. Select a Docker Container to Stop

Stop a Docker container interactively:

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | fzf)
```

This lists running Docker containers, lets you select one, and stops the selected container.

## 6. Quick Directory Navigation

Navigate to a directory:

```bash
cd $(find * -type d | fzf)
```

This command lists directories recursively, allowing you to select one to change into.

These examples illustrate how `fzf` can be integrated into daily shell tasks to make them more interactive and efficient. By harnessing `fzf`'s capabilities, you can streamline processes like file management, system monitoring, and navigating complex projects.
